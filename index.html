                    Akan Day Names and Their <br />
                    Hidden Meaning

                    In the typical African culture, you can tell quite a lot
                    about the circumstances of someone's birth from their given
                    names. A good example is an agelong tradition with the Akan
                    people of Ghana naming their children after the day of the
                    week they were born according to their Akan heritage before
                    westernization. These names were derivatives of the deities
                    worshipped by ancient Akan people and the deities'
                    corresponding day of worship. These names often depict
                    deeper meanings into a person's character and general
                    nature.
